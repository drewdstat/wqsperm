Description: Implements a permutation test method for the weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, building off the 'gWQS' package (Renzetti et al. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gWQS/gWQS.pdf>). Weighted quantile sum regression is a statistical technique to evaluate the effect of complex exposure mixtures on an outcome (Carrico et al. 2015 <doi:10.1007/s13253-014-0180-3>). The model features a statistical power and Type I error (i.e., false positive) rate tradeoff, as there is a machine learning step to determine the weights that optimize the linear model fit. This package provides an alternative method based on a permutation test that should reliably allow for both high power and low false positive rate when utilizing WQS regression (Loftus et al. 2021 <doi:10.1016/j.envint.2021.106409>).
